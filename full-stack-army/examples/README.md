# Create and Showcase Examples

Feel free to create examples & components. You can showcase your work directly here. For example, you have designed a card component or a cute nice alert box. You can share your code here with other learners. They can take motivation from your code and design. To get your example accepted, you have to follow the instructions below.

**Instructions:**

- Create a directory for your example project. When naming your directory, use lowercase letters and give it a meaningful name.
- Your directory must contain a `README.md` file describing your project, requirements, necessary screenshots, and other resources.
- Must follow a good directory structure.
